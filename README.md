# 11-3D-Game
A 3D game I developed for my MSCH C220 Game Technology class

As it stands, it is a very basic FPS tech demo. You have three weapons which you can switch between with the number keys, use wasd to move, left click to fire, and escape to restore mouse movement. A new dummy will spawn from the ceiling whenever an old one dies, and your kills are kept track of in the top left corner.

This is far from what I wanted to end up with. I had a dream of an elaborate wave shooter in a graveyard, where you faced off against hordes of (actually moving) undead. Unfortunately, I didn't account for the loss of time I would have over break, and ended up with a glimpse at the mechanics and nothing more. I focused too much on the mechanics of the game that I forgot to... make the game.

I do plan on completeing this, but as a passion project rather than for an actual grade. I'd hate to see all the effort I've put into this already go to waste
